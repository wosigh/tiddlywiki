	<h4>How to save the TiddlyWiki to USB drive?</h4>
	<p>
	  Just tap the <strong>Save</strong> button in the top menu bar. It
	  will save the wiki file to your USB drive (<strong>www/itw.html</strong>).
	</p>

	<h4>How to enter a new tiddler?</h4>
	<p>
	  Tap the <strong>Menu</strong> button in the top menu bar and select <strong>New Tiddler</strong>
	  from there. A new empty Tiddler (TiddlyWiki speaking of a "Wiki Page") appears.
	  Just enter a title, text and a couple of tags and you're done. Tap the <strong>done</strong>
	  button in the edit menu (blue coloured).
	</p>

	<h4>How do I add a Tiddler to the start screen?</h4>
	<p>
	  Open the Tiddler in question, edit it and add the following tag to it: <strong>Home</strong>.
	  Next time you visit the start screen (by using the menu or after saving and re-starting
	  TiddlyWiki) your Tiddler will appear there.
	</p>

	<h4>How do I add a link to a Tiddler to the top menu?</h4>
	<p>
	  Open the Tiddler in question, edit it and add the following tag to it: <strong>menu</strong>.
	  Now a link to the Tiddler will be shown in the menu.
	</p>	

	<h4>I bricked my TiddlyWiki, how do I resort to the last working copy?</h4>
	<p>
	  That's very easy: open the app menu and choose <strong>Restore</strong>. A list of
	  backup copies will appear, each backup file has the timestamp of its creation in
	  the filename. Tap on the copy you want to use to restore. Then, tap the <strong>Save</strong>
	  button in the top menu and it will be your production TiddlyWiki.
	</p>

	<h4>How can I import Tiddlers of my Tiddlywiki?</h4>
	<p>
           There are various ways to do it. You can use the <strong>ImportTiddlers</strong>
	   plugin in TiddlyWiki (reachable via Menu => Commands => ImportTiddlers) and import
	   from a remote URL whatever you need. Or, download the itw.html TiddlyWiki file to
	   your desktop, open it in your browser and add the Tiddlers you need from there. After
	   saving and uploading to your phone you'll have your stuff right there.
	</p>

	<h4>Will TiddlyWiki for webOS support advanced features like GTD ever?</h4>
	<p>
	   Depends. It will not be delivered with pre-installed GTD plugins of any kind
	   ever. It would become too large (thus slow) and GTD doesn't just fit to
	   the webOS screen dimensions. However, you may add this to your wiki yourself,
	   there are lots of resources on the web (look for "Monkey GTD" for example). But
	   be warned: you may have to invest a considerable amount of effort to modify it so
	   that it fits to webOS. If you ever made it, feel free to drop me a message,
	   so I can consider to add it to the distribution.
	</p>

	<h4>Sounds like a lot of work - how can I help?</h4>
	<p>
